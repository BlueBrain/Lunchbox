# Lunchbox

Welcome to Lunchbox, a C++ library for multi-threaded
programming. Lunchbox was formerly known as eq::base or co::base, the
foundation for the Equlizer parallel rendering framework and the Collage
network library. It is intended for all application developers creating
high-preformance multi-threaded programs.

## Features

Lunchbox provides the following major features to facilitate the
development and deployment of multi-threaded applications:
* OS Abstraction: Utility classes abstracting common operating systems
  features, e.g., threads, locks, memory maps, shared library loading
  and condition variables.
* High-Performance Primitives: Thread-safe utilities tuned for
  performance, e.g., atomic variables, spin locks and lock-free
  containers.
* Utility classes: Helper primitives which are not in the standard
  library, e.g., logging, pools and random number generation.
